# Knowledge Representation And Reasoning In The Context Of Automated Production Planning
ASP dataset suporting the Use Cases in the paper 'Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in the Context of Automated Production Planning

## Description
This repository contains two Answer Set Programming (ASP) rule files used in the research paper:

**Knowledge Representation And Reasoning In The Context Of Automated Production Planning**  
Authors: [Harkiran Sahota], [Adam Klodowski]  
Journal: *Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing*  
Submission Date: [2025-03-30]

The dataset includes:
- **.lp Files**: ASP rule files for two use cases described in the paper

## Usage Instructions
To execute the ASP rules, use **Clingo**, an open-source Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver:
1. Download and install Clingo from [Potassco](https://potassco.org/clingo/).
2. Run the following command in a terminal:
   ```
   clingo use_case1.lp
   ```
   or
   ```
   clingo use_case2.lp
   ```
3. Analyze the results for further processing.

Alternatively, you can use the **online Clingo solver** at: [https://potassco.org/clingo/](https://potassco.org/clingo/).

## Data Availability
The .lp files are provided under the **MIT Licens**.
The 3D model data used in the Hyllis research is **not openly available** but can be requested from the authors if necessary.
